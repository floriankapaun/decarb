# Internationalization (i18n)

This folder should function as the "Single Source of String Literals" which means, it should contain all hard-coded strings besides config values.

[`nuxt-i18n`](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org) is used for Internationalization. 

The configuration can be found in the `i18n` object in `nuxt.config.js`.
