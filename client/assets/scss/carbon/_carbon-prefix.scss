/**
 * Custom prefix for Carbon classes
 *
 * When transitioning to Carbon Design System v11 this will change to 'cds', see:
 * https://medium.com/carbondesign/carbons-2021-release-april-update-9d23242b3dea
 *
 * If you change the prefix in scss, you have to change it in .js as well, which
 * currently isn't possible – to my knowledge – in Vue so far.
